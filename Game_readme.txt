About the game:
With inspiration from duck hunt, here is a game, block hunt(low graphics...). Requires only a mouse to navigate and left mouse button to click.

How to play:
Click on the block before it touches the edge of the screen. Clicking elsewhere shall spawn a new block and reduce a life (total 3 lives), CLicking on the block earns +1 score. But difficulty increases as one scores more, speed increases and block size reduces. To win this game, get a score of 100. Are you up for the challenge?
